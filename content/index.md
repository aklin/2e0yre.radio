## 2E0YRE

My name is Tony Klinakis and my callsign is 2E0YRE. I hold an Intermediate license.
I used to be a member of the [Cray Valley Radio Society][cvrs], which helped me with my
license training. Many thanks to them.

I'm a current member of South Kent [RAYNET][raynet].

This page documents my radio exploits, such as they might be.

An email has not yet been set up for this domain.

You can contact me on [QRZ][qrz].

### Equipment

I own a number of Baofengs and a Yaesu FT-817. My favourite handheld radio has been
a Quangsheng which I have lost. It was my favourite because it could be charged via
USB-C, which means you didn't need a dedicated charger. I used to take it with me
everywhere, and ultimately I misplaced it.
