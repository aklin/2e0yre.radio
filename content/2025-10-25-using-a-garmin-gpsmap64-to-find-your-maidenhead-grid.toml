You _can_ use your Garmin to get Maidenhead, but it's not easy.

I own a Garmin GPSMAP 64, which can display your grid reference in the [Maidenhead
format][maidenhead].

The problem is, there is no quick way to switch from Maidenhead to WGS84 and vice versa.
You have to go into the settings, find the right sub-sub-menu, and activate it. When
you want to go back, you have to do it all over again.

I do wish that the setting could be saved in a Profile and switched more easily, this way
you could switch the Garmin on, get your Maidenhead, and be on your way for contacts.
